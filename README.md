# LightSpeed

LightSpeed is a Wpf and Prism based desktop application that has almost no real use whatsoever. The only reason for it even existing at all is to serve as a starting point for other master/detail style projects.

LightSpeed Incorporates:

A .Net Core 3 based runtime
A modular and composite architecture utilizing Prism 7.2
Entity Framework Core based data persistence
Support for data persistence framework interoperability through repository pattern implementation

A big thank you to Brain Lagunas and Prism community for helping me to learn prism.
